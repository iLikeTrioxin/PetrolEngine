In this file I generally describe style with which I am writing this project.
Those are totally subjective.

 - Variable names are written with lower camel case.
int someVariable;

 - Class names are written using upper camel case.
class SomeClass

 - Files and directories are also named upper camel case.
PetrolEngine/Deps/Xyz.cpp

 - Macros are upper case with words seperated with '_'
