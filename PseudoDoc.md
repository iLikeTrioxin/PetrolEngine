## Systems

### Goal
Goal of this section is to keep track of dependencies.
My go-to is to have as little dependencies per system as possible to basically make it a standalone module.
It will allow for better management and less messy code.

### Independent systems:
- Text
- Entity
- DebugTools

### Dependent systems:
- Text
    - Renderer (for creating textures)
